# FarmSystemManagment

#OBJECTIVE

This project is about creating a Java application for a large farm to manage the cows, sheep, their treatments and medication, as well as the vet and other staff working in the farm. In particular, it aims to maintain information about the animals, their illnesses and also the history of treatment of their illnesses

This project has two aims: (1) to learn how to connect a Java application to a backend database; (2) to learn how to use part of the object serialization and Java Security API, and multithreading. I will improve the project and connect it to a backend database and also use MD5 algorithm to do security checks in parallel with the main application.
